## Introduction

The model in this repository is built to recommend food items based on the ingredients provided by the users. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the ingredients and suggest suitable food options.

## Files

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training the recommendation model.
- `logs/fit/`: Folder containing logs from training the model, possibly from TensorBoard or other logging tools.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file listing the required dependencies for setting up the virtual environment.

## Setup

To set up the virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
3. Create a virtual environment using your preferred tool (e.g., virtualenv or conda).
4. Activate the virtual environment.
5. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To train the food recommendation model, open and execute the `main.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
